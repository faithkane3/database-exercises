-- LIMIT and OFFSET can be used to create multiple pages of data. What is the relationship between OFFSET (number of results to skip), LIMIT (number of results per page), and the page number?
-- Limit * (desired page number results - 1) = OFFSET number to see what is on your desired page results
-- For example, if you limit 5 results, and you want to see what is on the tenth page, you multiply 9, the first 9 pages,
-- by the number of 5, records per page, and you get 45 records. Your OFFSET should be set at 45 to skip the first 9
-- pages of results.
